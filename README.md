# Project Google Maps üåç

An app where I use the Google Maps API together with the Open Weather API to create a custom google map where the user can get data from chosen location from a world wide map.

## Features
- search any location
- find your position using the browser geolocation
- set markers on map
- get weather data on chosen location
